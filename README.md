* Put it in an [issue](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/issues).
* Clone the repo locally, make edits on a new branch, then create a pull request for it.
* Edit directly on Github, making sure to "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".

Please do not commit changes directly to the master branch.
