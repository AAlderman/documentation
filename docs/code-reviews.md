## What is a code review?

A code review is a critical quality assurance practice, commonly used in software development.

A code review typically involves:

1. checking a fellow programmer's (or researcher's) code for potential errors or possible improvements
2. providing constructive feedback to the author

Code reviews are standard practice within OpenSAFELY studies.
When making changes to study code, you should always have your proposed changes reviewed.

!!! note
    There is [more information on how to request and conduct code reviews](code-reviews-pull-request.md) in this documentation.

### Benefits of code review for authors and reviewers

Code reviews are learning and collaboration opportunities for both author and reviewer:

* *Authors* benefit from having reviewers look at the proposed changes, because the reviewer might:
  * spot bugs
  * think of wider considerations outside the code change being changed
  * think of alternative solutions that could be an improvement
* *Reviewers* benefit from seeing a particular code implementation:
  * the reviewer may be less familiar with the project
    (but, for critical changes, it is useful to have a reviewer be someone more familiar with the code)
  * the reviewer may learn about programming language features, styles or idioms they did not know
