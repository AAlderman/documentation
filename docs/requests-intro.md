OpenSAFELY uses GitHub to manage and share code and other platform resources.
If you want to request any changes to the platform then GitHub issues should be your first port of call.
Issues can be submitted for lots of different things &mdash; new variables or other features, bug reports, additional R or Stata packages, documentation updates, and so on.
You will need to choose the most appropriate repo to submit an issue. This will usually be obvious but issues can be moved to different repos if there's a better place so don't worry if you're not sure.

Before submitting a new issue, search existing issues to check your needs haven't already been reported or addressed.
By default, a search of a repository's issues will look for _open_ issues only.
It's often useful to also check _closed_ issues, as it may be for example that your request has already been implemented or is considered not possible.

The remaining pages provide details on how to submit issues for specific requests in OpenSAFELY.
