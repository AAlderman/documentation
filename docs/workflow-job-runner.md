Analysis scripts are submitted to the server via the Job Runner website at [https://jobs.opensafely.org](https://jobs.opensafely.org). 
Here you select a repo+branch, a set of actions to run (definined in the project pipeline), and the back-end you want to run against.
The Job Runner will take care of the rest.
It will produce the desired outputs on the server, which must be reviewed before release via GitHub.
See the [Project Pipelines section](pipelines-overview.md) for more details.
