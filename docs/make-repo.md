## Use a Template

For ease of use, we have created a research template that you should use for your study. 
Go to the [OpenSAFELY research template repo](https://github.com/opensafely/research-template) on GitHub. 
Click the green button that says <span style="background-color: green; color: white">&nbsp;**Use this template**&nbsp;</span>. 

Fill in the details:

- **owner**: select your personal GitHub for testing/experimenting, or select the opensafely organisation for a bona fide OpenSAFELY-approved study. The repo can be transferred into opensafely later if needed.
- **repository name**: This should always end in `-research` so that any back-end updates to the template can be pushed through to existing repos. The rest of the name should be something short but informative --- browse existing repo names for inspiration.
- **Description**: This will appear at the top of the repo on GitHub. No more than a sentence is needed as the repo should be explained fully in the README.
- **public / private**: select **private** initially, this can be changed later.
- **Include all branches**: Leave unchecked.

And submit. You will now be at the GitHub landing page for the repo.

## Update the README
The new repo will include a template README, which is used to help people understand the purpose of the repo, and how to navigate and use the code. The README should be updated to briefly describe the intended study and to reflect the repo's current status as a _work in progress_. The README should be updated frequently to reflect changes to the repo.

The README is written in Markdown. If you're not familiar with Markdown syntax, [read this](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github). There's a handy cheatsheet for the most useful Markdown syntax [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can update the README directly in GitHub. Click the edit button (a little pencil in the top-right), change the text, and commit the changes. This is a standard commit so there's not need to write more than "_first README update_", but typically commits should have a bit more detail than that.

## Clone the repo locally
Now we're going to download a copy of this repo to your machine so you can work on it locally. This is useful because you can:
* develop your code using familiar editing tools
* test and run code without disturbing other contributors
* ...

To clone your new repository to your machine, [follow these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) which explains cloning both via GitHub Deskop or via the command line. When this is done, you should have a folder whose name is the same as the repo on your machine.
