# Permissions in OpenSAFELY

After the data controller has [approved your project](https://www.opensafely.org/onboarding-new-users/), we will add any Github usernames listed in your approval to our `opensafely` Github organisation.  We also will transfer your existing OpenSAFELY study repository (if you have one) into the same organisation. This allows OpenSAFELY to enforce certain security standards, such as [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).

Additionally, the OpenSAFELY framework requires a user to be in the `opensafely` repository in order to [run jobs in the secure backends](job-server.md).

## Adding collaborators

While your repository is private, you may need to add new collaborators who are not named in your original application. Any new collaborators have the same information governance obligations as the original study authors, and must therefore sign the same access agreements; please send any such requests to [team@opensafely.org](mailto:team@opensafely.org).
