## Updating the documentation

OpenSAFELY is a rapidly changing platform and the user documentation should be updated frequently to keep pace. If you are an OpenSAFELY user and want to contribute corrections, clarifications, or new materials to the documentation, please do! You can either:

* Suggest improvements in an [issue](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/issues).
* Clone the repo locally, make edits on a new branch, then create a pull request for it.
* [Edit directly on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository), making sure to "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".

Please do not commit changes directly to the master branch.
