## Glossary
* **Underlying cause of death (icd10u)** _a cause code that identifies the medical condition judged to be the underlying cause of death according to the rules of 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases..._
_This field appears once for each cause coded routine and inquest death (deaths at age 28 days and over)._
_This code is generally known as 'the cause of death' and is used in single cause tabulations and analyses._
_The death is assigned the ICD10U code on the basis of ICD10 codes allocated to the death by the MICAR program. _
A coder may also manually assign these codes to a death record._
* **Primary / secondary cause of death** These are not concepts used in ONS cause of death data. 
There is the underlying cause, and then a list of up to 15 medical conditions (ICD10001 to ICD10015, given as ICD10 codes) mentioned on the death certificate. 
These codes are not ordered meaningfully.
