Write a `project.yaml` (see [here](pipelines.md)) and use `cohortextractor run dummy <action> expectations`.

The special action `run_all` will run everything.

Log files are written to a folder, created by `cohortextractor`, called `metadata/`; look there for clues if there are any errors.

More extensive documentation to follow!
