`git` is a command-line tool for recording, sharing and collaborating on code.

[Github](https://github.com) is a Microsoft-owned company (and website) that makes it easy to use `git`, and adds extra collaboration and security tools on top.  They also make Github Desktop, a convenient graphical user interface for git.

Github provide good documentation about best practices. [This walkthrough](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is essential reading for new users, and [this slideshow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) summarises some best practice.

## Editing the Study Definition and gitting changes

The general workflow for making changes to your code is as follows:

* Create a new branch. A branch is a way for you to record and publish your own changes without breaking things for other people who are using the same code. It is also a good way of collecting changes ("commits") into a meaningful unit that can be reviewed by others.
* Edit/add/delete files in the repo on that branch, committing regularly with informative commit messages.
* Push the changes to GitHub, so that others can view the branch.
* Continue to commit and push changes on that branch until you believe it's ready to be merged back into the main codebase that everyone uses.
* Submit a pull request (PR), requesting that the branch be reviewed by somebody else. A PR is simply a way of viewing, commenting on, and approving branches.
* Watch out for the automated tests passing or failing!
