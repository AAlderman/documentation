# Working with R
The OpenSAFELY R Image ships with a [given set of packages](https://github.com/opensafely/r-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile) baked in.

## Requesting Extra Packages
* Make an issue in https://github.com/opensafely/r-docker/issues
* Explain the rationale
* Get another member of the suppoRt group to chip in on the issue (e.g. do they agree; do they think a different package might do the same thing better)
* Assign to Simon when discussion finished
