Outputs can only be published by authorised users, who have permission to log inot the secure server.

Such users have responsibility for redacting sensitive information, or chosing not to publish it at all. Therefore, the study author should do everything they can to make this easy; for example, carrying out low number suppression themselves, documenting code clearly, and only selecting essential items for publication when deciding what to mark as `medium_privacy`.

The reviewer publishes outputs back to the original repo using git.
