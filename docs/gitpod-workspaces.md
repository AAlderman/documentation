To preserve usage minutes on Gitpod, you can manually stop a Gitpod
workspace as soon as you have finished with it. A workspace can be
stopped either in the workspace via the Gitpod button in the bottom-left
corner and then selecting "Gitpod: Stop workspace" in the dropdown menu.
or via visiting `https://gitpod.io`, hovering on the workspace,
left-clicking on the vertical dots (`⋮`) and selecting "Stop".

On the free plan, Gitpod workspaces allow 30 minutes of inactivity
before the workspace stops running. Stopped workspaces are not
immediately deleted; you have several days to open a stopped workspace
before its deletion.

You can see which Gitpod workspaces you have open by visiting
`https://gitpod.io` when logged into Gitpod, or clicking the Gitpod
button in the bottom-left of the screen and selecting "Gitpod: Open
dashboard". The stopped workspaces are visible by changing the search
filter from "Active" to "All", and you can open a stopped workspace by
hovering on the workspace, left-clicking on the vertical dots (`⋮`) and
selecting "Open".
