# Deploying

The [docs site](https://docs.opensafely.org) is served by [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/), using a webhook to build the [latest version](https://readthedocs.org/projects/opensafely-documentation/versions/) from the `master` branch when it is updated. 

There are a [few redirects](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/opensafely-documentation/redirects/) from old `stable` urls to current `latest` urls.
